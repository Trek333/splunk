<h1>Naming Ingested Containers</h1>
<p>
By default, the "source" field is used to name the ingested containers.
To customize the container names, use the two settings in the asset configuration.
For example, if a host name is expected in the container name, the "Name to give containers created via ingestion" parameter
can be set to "Notable Splunk Event" and "Values to append to container name" parameter can be set to "host".
This will set the container name to "Notable Splunk Event, host=my.sample.host".
The appended values can be a comma separated list.
</p>
<h2>Helpful examples:</h2>
<pre>
For "on poll"
- In case "on poll" returns any 4XX except 403, validate your search Query on Splunk.
- Sample "Query" to use with On Poll: index=_internal | stats count by host, source sourcetype | head 5 | rename host as h0st |  rename source as devicehostname
- Sample "Fields to save with On Poll" (if none given, "on poll" shall store all the fields): source,sourcetype,hostname
- The <b>on_poll_parse_only</b> parameter, if <b>True</b>, it disables the expansion of search due to evaluation of sub-searches, time term expansion, lookups, tags, eventtypes, and sourcetype alias. This parameter is used for the validation of the Splunk query before fetching the results.
