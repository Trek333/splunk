<h1>Naming Ingested Containers</h1>
<p>
You can change how the containers are named using two settings in the configuration.
First, you can specify a name prefix. It could for example be "Notable Splunk Event".
You can also specify values to append to this name. For example, if you expect for there
to be a "host" in the created artifact, and set that to the value, then the name of the created
container will be "Notable Splunk Event, host = &lt;host&gt;". This field accepts a comma seperated list.
If no name is specified, it will default to naming from the "source" field.
</p>
