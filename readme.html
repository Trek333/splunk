<h1>Naming Ingested Containers</h1>
<p>
By default, the "source" field is used to name the ingested containers.
To customize the container names, use the two settings in the asset configuration.
For example, if a host name is expected in the container name, the "Name to give containers created via ingestion" parameter
can be set to "Notable Splunk Event" and "Values to append to container name" parameter can be set to "host".
This will set the container name to "Notable Splunk Event, host=my.sample.host".
The appended values can be a comma separated list.
</p>
